K-core clustering

The objective is to identify and extract k-core clusters from an input graph represented by a 26x26 matrix. The input graph is constructed by generating a 10- digit sequence from an individual's student ID, where each digit is replaced with either 1 or 0 based on its parity (even or odd). This sequence is then repeated 68 times to form a 680-bit long sequence.
 
  The concept of k-core clustering refers to the identification of dense subgraphs within a larger graph structure. In this case, the goal is to identify k-core clusters within the input graph. A k-core cluster is a subgraph where each node has at least k connections within the subgraph.
  
  By applying k-core clustering to the input graph, we aim to extract cohesive groups of nodes that are densely interconnected, revealing the underlying structure and patterns within the graph. This process helps in understanding the relationships and communities present within the graph, which can have various applications in network analysis, social network analysis, and graph mining.
